Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin - Statistical Methods 2022 (Prof. Dr. Marek Kowalski). Examples covered by Alice Townsend.

# Technical requirements

## Python

In exercise classes, we will use Python to apply statistical methods to some data.

If you do not already have python (open a terminal and try ipython), download everything from Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution (latest version is probably best).

## Git

For the Linux/OSX users, the best is to use the git command lines (git clone / git add / git commit / git push / git pull)

For Windows users (and Unix users who do not like command lines...), see desktop github: https://desktop.github.com.
