## Python

In exercise classes, we will use Python to apply statistical methods to some data.

If you do not already have python (open a terminal and try ipython), download everything from Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution (latest version is probably best).

You can open a jupyter notebook by typing ** jupyter notebook ** in the terminal. From there, you can create a new iPython notebook (.ipynb) file.

There are *millions* of Python tutorials online to help you get started if you are new to this language, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you are stuck.

## Git

For the Linux/OSX users, it is best to use the git command lines:
- **git clone** to copy a github repository
- **git add** to add a file change to be committed
- **git commit** to commit a change
- **git push** to push the commit to the repo
- **git pull** to pull any new changes from the repo

For Windows users (and Unix users who do not like command lines...), see Desktop Github: https://desktop.github.com.
